# IoT Security Vulnerability Analysis

**COMP2500 Security Principles - Final Project**
**Authors:** Mohammed-Ali Medhat & Rye Stefani

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis...

## Key Findings
- 82% of papers identified weak authentication...
```

### **File 2: simple_demo.py**
**This is a separate Python file**

**Content:** The code you currently see (the Python script with `def show_vulnerabilities():` etc.)

## 🔧 **How to Fix This:**

### **Step 1: Fix README.md**

1. You're currently editing README.md (good!)
2. **Delete ALL that Python code** you pasted
3. Go to the `README_simple.md` file I created
4. Copy THAT content instead
5. Paste it into your README.md
6. Click "Commit changes"

### **Step 2: Add simple_demo.py**

1. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
2. Name it: `simple_demo.py`
3. Copy the Python code (the stuff that starts with `"""IoT Security Analysis...`)
4. Paste it there
5. Click "Commit new file"

## 📋 **Quick Checklist:**

After you're done, your GitHub should have:
```
iot-security-analysis/
├── README.md          ← Text description (markdown)
└── simple_demo.py     ← Python script (code)
